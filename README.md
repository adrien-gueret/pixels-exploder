# Pixels Exploder
A script separating pixels from an image. Just for fun. Could be useful for post-its wars :)

Check demo on https://adrien-gueret.github.io/pixels-exploder/

Sadly, this works well only on **Chrome**: you can have some blury effects when using big pixels on other browsers.  
Furthermore, with **Chrome**, you can save the generated image with a right click on it :)
